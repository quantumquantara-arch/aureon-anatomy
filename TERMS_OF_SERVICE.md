These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the App.

### 2. Eligibility and User Account

    *   Task management and artifact creation within your personal Aureon environment.

3.2. **No Per-Usage Fees for Core AI:** Aureon operates on a post-billing architecture. While your access may be governed by a subscription plan (see Section 5), you will not be charged per token, per API call, or per media generation for functionalities explicitly included in your plan.

3.3. **Fair Use Policy:** While designed for "unlimited" use, Aureon reserves the right to implement a Fair Use Policy to prevent abuse, protect system integrity, and ensure equitable access for all users. This policy, if implemented, will be clearly communicated and may involve temporary rate limiting for extreme, non-human-like usage patterns.

### 4. User Content and Data

This license extends to any derived works generated by Aureon based on your User Content.

4.3. **Privacy:** Your privacy is important to us. Our [**INSERT LINK TO PRIVACY POLICY**] explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal data and User Content. By using the App, you agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy.

4.4. **Data Persistence:** User Content and conversational context related to your account are designed to persist within Aureon's Geometric Lattice for continuous, infinite context.
